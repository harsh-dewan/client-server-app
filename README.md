#Custom Command Client-Server System

Technology: C, Socket Programming

#Project Overview
Developed a robust client-server system using socket programming in C, designed to facilitate seamless communication through custom commands. This system was engineered to be both scalable and reliable, incorporating sophisticated error handling mechanisms to ensure consistent performance and resilience.

#Key Features and Functionality

#Client-Server Communication:
    Utilized TCP/IP sockets to establish a reliable connection between clients and the server.
    Implemented a multi-threaded server to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.
    
#Custom Commands:
  Designed a set of custom commands for clients to interact with the server, enabling tasks such as data retrieval, updates, and server management.
  Commands included functionalities like file transfer, remote execution of tasks, and real-time data processing.


#Error Handling and Reliability:
  Developed comprehensive error handling routines to manage network issues, invalid commands, and unexpected disconnections.
  Implemented retry mechanisms and fallback procedures to maintain system stability and ensure continuous operation.

#Scalability:
  Architected the server to support horizontal scaling, allowing the addition of more server instances to handle increased load.
  Optimized the network protocol and data structures to minimize latency and maximize throughput.
  
#Security:
  Incorporated basic security measures such as client authentication and command authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
  Used encryption for sensitive data transmission to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
